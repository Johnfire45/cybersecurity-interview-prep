## 🔐 Risk Management — Summary Notes

### ✅ What Is Risk Management?
A formal process used to identify, assess, prioritize, and treat risks to organizational assets (people, data, infrastructure). Ensures risks are addressed proactively, not reactively.

### 🧱 Core Risk Management Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Key Points | Best For |
|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| **NIST RMF** | U.S. Federal Systems | 6-step lifecycle: Categorize → Select → Implement → Assess → Authorize → Monitor | Compliance-heavy orgs |
| **ISO 31000** | Enterprise Risk | Strategic, business-aligned risk mgmt | Global orgs, business integration |
| **FAIR** | Quantitative Risk | Measures cyber risk in $$ | GRC, CISO-level reporting |
| **OCTAVE** | Operational Risk | Asset/threat-centric, business process driven | Mid-sized orgs |
| **COBIT** | Governance & Audit | IT control/governance, compliance | Auditors, GRC frameworks |

---

### 🔁 Typical RMF Workflow

1. **Asset Inventory** – Identify what to protect
2. **Threat Modeling / Risk Identification**
3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
4. **Risk Evaluation** – Likelihood × Impact
5. **Control Implementation** – Preventive/Detective/Corrective
6. **Monitoring** – Ongoing risk validation and control tuning

### 🧠 Interview Insights

| Asked As... | You Should Discuss... |
|-------------|------------------------|
| “How do you choose a risk framework?” | Depends on regulatory, business, or quant needs |
| “How to report risk to execs?” | Use FAIR to translate technical risk into financial exposure |
| “What’s the difference between ISO 31000 and NIST RMF?” | ISO = business risk, NIST = IT/system lifecycle |
| “How to audit controls?” | Mention COBIT, control objectives, policy enforcement |

### 🛠️ Common Tools & Practices
- **GRC Platforms**: ServiceNow, Archer
- **Risk Registers**: Excel or tooling-based tracking of risk entries
- **Control Frameworks**: NIST 800-53, CIS Controls
- **Metrics**: Risk heatmaps, residual risk scores, KRIs (Key Risk Indicators)

---

### 📌 Key Takeaways
- RMFs are essential in **governance**, **compliance**, and **long-term security posture**.
- **Choosing the right RMF** depends on org size, industry, regulatory needs, and leadership goals.
- Combine **RMF + threat modeling** for both top-down and system-level assurance.
