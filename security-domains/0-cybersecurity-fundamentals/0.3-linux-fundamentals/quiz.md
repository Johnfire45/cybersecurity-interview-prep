### üß® Real-World Scenario ‚Äî Privilege Escalation via `find` in sudoers

Your organization's Linux servers include the following line in `/etc/sudoers.d/devs`:

```
%devs ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
```

A Red Team operator was able to escalate to root using this configuration.

#### Q:  
How could this misconfiguration lead to privilege escalation, and what mitigation would you recommend?

---

#### ‚úÖ Answer:
Allowing `find` with root privileges (and no password) enables abuse because `find` can execute arbitrary commands via the `-exec` flag. An attacker in the `devs` group can escalate by running:

```bash
sudo find / -exec /bin/bash \;
```

This executes a root shell, fully compromising the system.

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigations:
- Avoid granting `sudo` access to binaries like `find`, `vim`, or `less` that support command execution
- If `sudo` access is required, restrict to **safe, non-interactive subcommands** using `Cmnd_Alias`
- Require password prompt (`NOPASSWD` is dangerous on interactive commands)

---

#### üîç Detection Strategies:
- Monitor `/var/log/auth.log` or journald for suspicious `sudo` executions (e.g., `find -exec`)
- SIEM correlation rules to flag unusual binary usage under elevated privileges

---

#### üìö Bonus:
Other commonly misused binaries for sudo privilege escalation:
- `vim`
- `less`
- `awk`
- `perl`
- `tar`
- `python`

## üîê Topic: Linux Fundamentals ‚Äî File Permissions & Privilege Escalation

### üß® Real-World Scenario

Your organization has a shared directory `/opt/scripts/` that is writable by members of the `devteam` group. Inside this directory exists a script named `deploy.sh`, which is executable via `sudo` without requiring a password:

```bash
(devteam) ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/scripts/deploy.sh
```

### ‚ùì Question

What is the **most critical security risk** introduced by this configuration?

- A. Members of `devteam` can run `deploy.sh` without a password  
- B. The `deploy.sh` script can be modified by any `devteam` user, potentially leading to root privilege escalation  
- C. The `deploy.sh` script is stored outside the `/usr/bin` directory  
- D. Users in `devteam` can audit the output of the script via log files  

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Answer: **B**

### üí° Explanation:

- ‚úÖ The script resides in a **writable directory**, allowing users to **modify or replace the file** with a malicious version.
- ‚úÖ The script is executed with **`sudo` without password**, meaning **modified contents run as root**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This opens a path for **privilege escalation**, such as:
  - Injecting reverse shells
  - Modifying critical files
  - Adding unauthorized users
- ‚ùå The issue is not that `devteam` can run the script, but that they can **alter what gets run with root privileges**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation:

- ‚úÖ Move scripts to a **non-writable directory** (e.g., `/usr/local/sbin`)
- ‚úÖ Lock down permissions (`root:root`, `0755`)
- ‚úÖ Remove `NOPASSWD` where not strictly required
- ‚úÖ Audit all `sudoers` entries that refer to user-controlled paths
- ‚úÖ Implement file integrity monitoring or AppArmor/SELinux enforcement

### üß® Real-World Scenario ‚Äî Reverse Shell via Misconfigured Cron Job

**Scenario:**  
You are a security analyst in a fintech company. During a routine investigation, you notice a strange network connection from one of your internal development servers to an unknown external IP on port `4444`. The team insists no services should be communicating outbound on that port. Upon deeper inspection, the `/opt/devops/scripts/deploy.sh` file was recently modified by a developer. This file is run frequently via cron and has `sudo` permissions without password prompt.

You also find that:
- The `devteam` group has write access to `/opt/devops/scripts/`
- A process tree shows:  

cron ‚îÄ‚îÄ sh ‚îÄ‚îÄ python ‚îÄ‚îÄ bash

---

**Q:**  
What is the most likely security issue here, and how would you investigate and respond to confirm a potential reverse shell?

---

**A:**  
The key issue is a **privilege escalation risk** due to the writable `deploy.sh` script executed with `sudo` via cron. A malicious insider (or compromised developer account) could inject a **reverse shell payload** (e.g., Python one-liner) into the script. Since cron executes it with elevated privileges, this allows attackers to gain root access and establish an external connection.

**Indicators:**
- `devteam` has write access to sensitive executable scripts
- Cron executes the script silently and recurrently
- Process tree showing unexpected outbound behavior (`python ‚Üí bash`)
- No alerting or audit mechanism is in place

**Recommended Actions:**
- üîç Check last modified time of `deploy.sh`
- üßæ Review cron job schedules and user context
- üìú Audit bash history and auth logs
- üåê Correlate outbound connection logs with known IOCs
- üîí Remove group write permissions on scripts in cron context
- üõ°Ô∏è Enforce `sudo` policies with password + logging
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Introduce real-time alerts for outbound traffic on uncommon ports

---

**Q:**  
During an investigation, you discover that a suspicious database exfiltration occurred around 02:00 AM.  
As the security engineer, which Linux log file would you check first, and what other logs/tools would you review to confirm and correlate the incident?  

---

**A (Your Answer):**  
I would check `/var/log/auth.log` first, since it records authentication attempts like SSH logins and sudo usage.  

---

**Correct Answer (Comparison):**  
- ‚úÖ **First check:** `/var/log/auth.log` (authentication attempts, sudo usage, privilege escalation).  
- üîπ **Then correlate with:**  
  - `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` (system events, cron jobs, daemon activity).  
  - `/var/log/audit/audit.log` (if auditd enabled, shows sensitive file access).  
  - Web/service logs (e.g., `/var/log/nginx/access.log` or DB logs).  
  - Network activity logs (`kern.log`, IDS alerts, or packet captures).  
- üîπ **Commands/Tools:**  
  - `grep "02:" /var/log/auth.log` for filtering.  
  - `journalctl --since "2025-08-20 01:30:00" --until "2025-08-20 02:30:00"`.  
  - `ausearch` if auditd is enabled.  

**Comparison Note:**  
Your answer correctly identified `auth.log` as the starting point.  
To be interview-ready, also mention **system, audit, web/service, and network logs** for full incident correlation.  

### Comprehensive Question ‚Äî Crons, Daemons, and Services

**Question:**  
You are performing a Red Team vs Blue Team exercise on a Linux server.  
During the assessment:  
- As the **Red Team attacker**, you need persistence across reboots without root privileges.  
- As the **Blue Team defender**, you later investigate and suspect malicious persistence in the system.  

**Tasks:**  
1. As an attacker, what methods could you use for persistence leveraging **crons, daemons, or services**? Provide both stealthy and noisy examples.  
2. As a defender, what specific checks and commands would you run to detect such persistence mechanisms?  
3. Map these techniques to **MITRE ATT&CK** and **OWASP Top 10** categories.  
4. What is the best long-term defensive strategy to mitigate and continuously monitor against such persistence?  

---

**Answer (Key Points):**  
1. **Red Team Persistence Methods**  
   - **Cron:**  
     - Noisy ‚Üí `*/5 * * * * /bin/bash reverse.sh`  
     - Stealthy ‚Üí `@reboot /home/user/.backup.sh` (hidden script with payload)  
   - **Daemon/Service:**  
     - Malicious systemd unit ‚Üí `/etc/systemd/system/update-checker.service` with reverse shell.  
   - **Systemd Timer:**  
     - Fake `logrotate.timer` that executes a malicious script.  

2. **Blue Team Detection Commands**  
   - Cron: `crontab -l`, check `/etc/crontab` and `/etc/cron.*` directories.  
   - Services: `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service`, inspect `.service` files for `ExecStart`.  
   - Timers: `systemctl list-timers --all`, inspect `.timer` + linked `.service` files.  

3. **Mappings**  
   - **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job), T1053.006 (Systemd Timers).  
   - **OWASP:** A05 ‚Äî Security Misconfiguration (unmonitored jobs/services).  

4. **Best Long-Term Defense**  
   - Baseline and continuously monitor:  
     - `/etc/systemd/system/*.service` and `*.timer`  
     - `/etc/cron.*` and user crontabs  
   - Implement file integrity monitoring (Wazuh, OSSEC, auditd).  
   - Alert on suspicious `ExecStart` or cron commands (`curl | bash`, reverse shells).  
   - Preserve evidence before containment.

### Interview One-Liner
‚ÄúPersistence on Linux can be achieved via **cron jobs, daemons, or systemd timers**.  
Attackers prefer stealthy methods like hidden scripts or fake timers.  
Defenders must **baseline & monitor unit files and crontabs** ‚Äî this ensures detection of unauthorized changes while preserving evidence.‚Äù

### Q3 ‚Äî Red vs Blue Bash Script (Summary)

**Scenario:**  
A script parses log files and blocks IPs with iptables:
for ip in $(cat $LOGFILE | awk '{print $1}'); do
  iptables -A INPUT -s $ip -j DROP
done

---

**Red Team Exploit:**  
- Log file is attacker-controlled ‚Üí injects malicious payload into column 1.  
- Unquoted `$ip` and unsafe loop (`for $(...)`) lead to command injection.  
- Example: adding `; rm -rf /;` as a log entry executes arbitrary commands.  

---

**Blue Team Fix:**  
- Quote all variables: `"$ip"`, `"$LOGFILE"`.  
- Use safe loop: `while read -r ip; do ... done`.  
- Validate input strictly (regex for IPv4/IPv6).  
- Enforce safe Bash options: `set -euo pipefail`.  
- Use `--` to stop option parsing in commands.  
- Protect log integrity: restrict permissions, centralize logging.  

---

**Secure Rewrite (example):**
set -euo pipefail
while read -r ip; do
  if [[ "$ip" =~ ^([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$ ]]; then
    iptables -A INPUT -s "$ip" -j DROP
  fi
done < <(awk '{print $1}' "$LOGFILE")

---

**Mappings:**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1059.004 (Bash), T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job)  
- **OWASP:** A08 (Software and Data Integrity Failures), A05 (Security Misconfiguration)  

---

**Interview One-Liner:**  
‚ÄúUnquoted variables and unsafe parsing in Bash scripts lead to command injection.  
The secure fix is quoting, validating inputs, using safe loops, enforcing strict Bash options, and protecting log integrity.‚Äù
