# Task: Sync Progress and Context for Cybersecurity Interview Prep

## Context:

We've now completed **all subtopics under `0.2 Security Programs & Frameworks`**, and they've been manually marked with ðŸŸ¢ in `_progress.md`.  
Per `gpt-persistence-context.md`, the ðŸŸ¢ mark is the **only source of truth** for topic mastery.

## What needs to happen:

Please review both `_progress.md` and `context.md` and figure out what updates are required to make the files fully consistent with the current progress state.

Consider:

- Does the **domain-level status for `0.2`** reflect that all subtopics are completed?
- Is the **summary at the top of `_progress.md`** accurate?
- Is `context.md` showing the correct **content status summary** and **progress mapping**?
- Are there any **orphaned, out-of-sync, or redundant entries**?

## Request:

- **First, discuss what changes you believe are needed** to fully align the project with the manual progress.
- Then apply the necessary updates to `_progress.md` and `context.md`.

Respect the rule:  
**Never override or infer ðŸŸ¢ marks. Only update based on the actual file state.**

## Files to use:

- `_progress.md`
- `context.md`
- `gpt-persistence-context.md`
