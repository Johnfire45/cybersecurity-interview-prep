# Cybersecurity Interview Preparation Plan

## âœ… Structure and Plan
Harshit will go topic by topic across all domains in cybersecurity (Application Security, API Security, Android Security, Network Security, Cloud Security, DevSecOps, and more). For each topic and subtopic:
- ChatGPT will quiz Harshit or ask for demonstrations/answers
- Feedback will be given only after Harshit asks for it
- ChatGPT will not proceed to the next subtopic until Harshit confirms
- ChatGPT will not proceed to the next main topic until Harshit confirms
- Harshit will ask for Cursor prompts when needed (not automatically sent)
- All context will be preserved for long-term interview tracking and can be resumed later
