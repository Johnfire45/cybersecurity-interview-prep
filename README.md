# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Interview Preparation — Harshit Shah

This repository contains my structured and in-depth preparation for cybersecurity job interviews across multiple domains — including application, API, Android, network, cloud, and DevSecOps security.

Each section includes notes, testing strategies, hands-on tasks, and Cursor prompts. This project follows a high-discipline, topic-by-topic review strategy with feedback and progression checkpoints.
